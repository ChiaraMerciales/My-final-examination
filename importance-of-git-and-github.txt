GitHub is a website for developers and programmers to collaboratively work on code, both Git and GitHub give programmers valuable version-control functionality so that
they can build ongoing coding projects without being afraid of messing everything up. The importance of Git and Github is that, it makes it easy to contribute to your
open source projects, Git tracks the changes you make to files, so you have a record of what has been done, and you can revert to specific versions should you ever need to.
Git also makes collaboration easier, allowing changes by multiple people to all be merged into one source which allows for seamless collaboration without compromising the
integrity of the original project.
